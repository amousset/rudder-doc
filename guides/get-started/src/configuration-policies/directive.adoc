== Use a predefined policy

You have just learnt to use the technique editor, which gives access to a broad
range of building blocks for policies. To allow easy configuration of
common system settings, Rudder also comes with a pre-defined set of techniques,
directly usable.

Go to the "Configuration Manegement -> Directive" page. What is a directive? It is a technique instance:
une technique plus some paramreters, makeing it an appliable p√Æece of configuration.

This is smallest building block for appliable policies.

We will now configure the SSH service on our nodes using the dedicated pre-built technique.

Let's use the filter in the directive tree to find it easily:

Now click on it, the right part of the page will display the technique details, and
the list of available versions of the technique. We will use the latest one, by clicking on
"Create with latest version".

This will make a new form appear, containing the configuration of the directive itslef.
As we said before, a technique is a parametrizable policy. A directive is a technique instance,
i.e. a techniques plus a set of parameters.

Defining a directive consist of choosing a technique and providing parameters for it.

Let's decide ho we want to configure our SSH server. Let's give it a description.
When using Rudder, keep in mind that filling all these documentation filed, though it may seem
tedious, is very important for future reference, or collaboration with other.
Is is for example useful to include reference to external information (ticketing system, etc.),
to allow keeping a track of all configuration changes.

Let's disable password authentication:

image::./ssh-password.png["SSH technique", align="center"]

And go to the bottom of the page, click on "Global confguration for all nodes"
(to apply it everywhere, we will see how it works later).

image::./rule.png["SSH technique", align="center"]

And click on save. It will open a window asking for confirmation and an audit message,
that is used for tracability. Let's leave it empty for now, and confirm.

Why a confirmation window here? Because the change we are saving will *change our machines state*.
Once you click on save, the Rudder server will start creating configuration policies for nodes
it is applied to (we will see later which ones exactly).

Let's create a second directive, based on the technique we have just created (our demo user).
Use the filter to find it in the directive tree, still on the Directives page.

This time, we will change one of the general parameters by overriding the policy mode to Audit mode.

image::./audit.png["Audit mode", align="center"]

Then apply it to the "Global configuration for all nodes" and save.

You have just applied your first configuration policy.
If you wait just a bit (at most 5 minutes), our expected state will be applied on our machine
(actually only our Rudder server itself for now).

But we will ave a closer look at what happens on the machine in the next section.
