== Audit vs. Enforce - Policy Mode

As you saw just before, we configured one of our directives in "Audit mode".
You may have guessed, according to its name, what this means.

Rudder has two available policy modes:

* Enforce
* Audit

The enforce mode will modify the target system, if necessary, to achieve the expected state.
The audit mode will only report about non-compliances.

What we can do now is to change the policy mode of the directive to use the default value, and re run the agent.

Go back to the directive. You can use the Directive page, or use the quick search field, in the
header bar. Here you can search for any Rudder item (there is even a small query language).

And click on your directive to go to its configuration page.Now change policy mode to
default.

You can get back to your SSH session, and re-run

----
rudder agent update
rudder agent run
----

You will see the actual modification happening, with a "repaired" state. If you go back to the dashboard, everything is green and compliance has reached 100%.

This policy mode can be used in different cases:

* Adding an existing machine, to check if its state matches the expected state, and only
enable modification mode if it is correct, to avoid breaking anything
* Adding a configuration item on nodes chere it was not previously managed. It allows easily checking if
assumptions about the current state are correct before changing anything.

We will now see how to manage other nodes, and more advanced configuration features.
