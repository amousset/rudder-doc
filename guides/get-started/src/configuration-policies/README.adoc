= Define configuration policies

Rudder's goal is to manage the configuration of your machines:

* Package httpd installed in version 2.4.12
* Service ntpd is currently running
* SSH connection using passwords are disabled
* A specific prompt is deployed on production nodes
* etc.

Configuration is managed through the definition of an desired state for each machine.
This means you will not define a list of steps towards the expected state, like in a script,
but a set of states for each item you want to manage (which
is key to create reliable configuration policies).

[NOTE]

====

A managed machine is called a *node* in Rudder.

====

The desired state is applied by Rudder agents on each node, and the information about its application
is continuously updated on the server. In this section, we will see two ways to define configuration policies, let's get started!
