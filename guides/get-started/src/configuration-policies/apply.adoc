== Run agent locally

Let's connect to our Rudder server by SSH:

----
vagrant ssh server
sudo -i # to get a root access
----

We will use the `rudder` command that gives access to all Rudder actions.

But first, let's explain a bit how things work on the agent.
We saw that the server generates an appliable configuration
for the expected state of the machine.

The agent that runs on all o the se machines will download the latest version
of its policies, and apply the locally. To trigger this process manually, run:

----
rudder agent update # to update the policies rom the server
rudder agent run    # to apply these policies locally
----

This will display the state of all applied components, including the ones you have defined before.

The rest of the components are called system techniques, you can ignore them for now. They are
responsible for maintaining the Rudder services themselves, and hence not editable by users.

Lets's get back to the web interface, on the dashboard:

You can see that compliance information got back to the server, and is used to
display the current state in the dashboard.

We have now finished our first policy application, from definition, using a new technique
or a built-in one, and an application on our Rudder server.

We will now dig a bit deeper on what the policy mode we modified is, and how to use use it.
