== Classify machines

In Rudder, we never apply policies to individual nodes, but always to sets of nodes.

[NOTE]

====

A *group* is query over inventory data that defines a set of nodes,
on which policies can be applied.

====

In this section, you will learn how to specify such queries, and build
consistent groups.

Go to the "Node Management -> Groups" page, you will see a tree on the left.

This is the tree of groups, with a hierarchy made of group categories

[NOTE]

====

*Group categories* are just there to visually organize groups and have no effect on
the content of the groups or applied configuration.

====

There is a set of pre-defined groups (called system groups), that
covers Rudder-related classification.

We will define a group made of all nodes running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Click on "Create" in the groups tree. You will then see a popup asking for several parameters.

The group type is "dynamic", which means the content of the group will be automatically
updated whenever a nodes should enter or leave the group depending on its inventory data.

Then click on "Create", and the new group will appear in the tree.
Scroll down to go to the group definition.

Click on "Search" to make the actual search over node information, you should see
the "node" machine in the list. The server does not appear as Rudder servers are excluded from groups by default. Click on "Save".

We now have defined a first custom group. You can use any acombination of criteria based
on the inventory data.

[TIP]
.How to design groups in Rudder?
====

The best practice advice to:

* Create multiple layers of groups:

** Geograpic (Datacenter, rack, etc.)
** Business (Production, QA, etc.)
** Applicative (Installed application, etc.)
** System (Operating system, etc.)
** etc.

* Build subgroups using the belonging to another group as a criteria,
which allows expressing complex cases without duplicating query definition
