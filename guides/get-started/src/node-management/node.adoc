== Add a new machine

In the demo platform, you have two nodes:

* The `server` we already used
* A `node` machine

This machine already has Rudder installed, and we will see how

[NOTE]

====

An *inventory* contains hardware and software information about a node.
It is sent to register the node to the server after agent installation, and then
gets updated daily (during the night, at a random time).

You can manually trigger an inventory with `rudder agent inventory`.
