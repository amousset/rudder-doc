== Providing configuration data

data vs. code

For now we have only manipulated statically defined information, may it be for group definition or
inside the configuration themselves. This is the simplest use-case, but Rudder allows
to easily define and use dynamic data.

[NOTE]

====

In this section we will see:

* how to attach data to each node
* how to use it for group definition
* how to use it inside configuration policies

====

Rudder has basically 3 types of variable data:

* Global parameters that apply to the whole Rudder instance
* Variable definition inside configuration policies
* Variable associated to a node



We will define a property for our node:

Go to the node details, for example using the quick search bar,
and go to the "Properties" tab. This is a small key-value database associated to each node.

Define a "env" = "production" variable.

Then click on the plus sign to add the property.

We now have associated a new property tour our node.
Let's use it to define a group of production boxes.


Go to the groups page, and create the "Production nodes" group,
defined by:

image::./production.png["Definition of the production group", align="center"]

It should contain our "node" machine.

We will also start defining data for the next policy we will build,
still for the "node" machine.

Let's define a property called `website`, with the following content:

----
{
  "host": "mysite.example.com",
  "port": 8080
}
----

This will be translated in the configuration of a website we will do on the
"node" machine in the next part of this tutorial.



To sum things up:

* Rudder has rich variables features
* Variables can be scalar or hierarchical objects
* Variables can be defined on the server: globally, by policy or by node
* Node variables can be used for business-oriented classification
* Variables can be defined locally, during agent evaluation, to use local data
